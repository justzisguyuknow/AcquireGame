AcquireGame
===========

This is a shitty text-based version of the classic board game Acquire.

It's not very useful now, because it only works on one screen.

I am planning to add an actual gui and get it running on an online server so people can play remotely.

acquiremain.py is the core of the program, use acquiremain.start() to start a game and acquiremain.run() to continue an ongoing game.
